<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
Because the project scope is micro-targeted, both in the scale of the intervention, as well as the
catchment, the data gather should seek to satisfy more qualitative questions, than hard
quantitative ones. Hence, the goal is to demonstrate replicability of the intervention by showing
consistency in engagement as opposed to measuring against a particular data trend that has a
defined intervention. While the data maybe incipient, it can be cross-sectionally compared to the
larger trends in the community. Focusing on a mixture of process and impact evaluation.
The project seeks to measure, how are we engaging (social media, direct-to-constituent etc.)
through the foundation of coding and the effectiveness of that engagement (how many unique
users per cycle). These data points will be captured using traditional methods i.e. sign-in sheets
that ask for information regarding the age-ethnicity-language-gender pronoun-social issue and
income level. We will also measure engagement in usage hours relative to hours of operation.
However, because this population is more net-savvy, we will also focus both our engagement via
social media platforms, such as the communication tool created by the young people. Where we
can not only provide a quick update with a post and garner data around interest but use the
platforms as potential means of dissemination of events, capture sentiments using online polling
to determine immediate sentiment and host webinar style workshops where the users can
comment in real-time, making their experience qualifiable. Noting again that the impact is
scaled, so too will what we determine to be a well-conceived intervention. The core focuses of
the project is connectivity. The goal of the project will be to ensure that youth have access to a
vast array of information, a developed network of content that is centered around material
knowledge of the employment industries, educational opportunities, and other socially focused
resources.
</p>
<p>
The project will look to host workshops (per cohort) on a topic of youth choice. The goal of
these workshops are not only exposure to industries of choice, but to provide the youth images of
leaders who resemble them.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the project will host wellness-campaign workshops around mental health, all these
events will be measured by satisfaction questionnaires that are given at the end of each
workshop. In total, Neighborhood Stat team seeks to engage up to 60 youth in 4 Cohorts which
expand through a 6 month period in the activities set forth. Because we also want to measure
long-term impact, follow-up calls, with "alum" of the program after the completion of the cohort
after their usage. We will also seek to connect them to other organizations where their digital
enterprise work can continue.
</p>
<p>
The raw data collected from all engagement will be migrated to excel sheets and properly
categorized. The information will help to compile both an existing list of users and help define the metric points collected. The data will then become part of a larger data trend analysis
convened at NeighborhoodStat meetings and other topical community-based forums
</p>
<p>
Initially the data collected will be kept both in a secure drawer, and digital folders, these folders
will be initially managed by the MEC employed by the Center for Court innovation,
subsequently, the data generated will be passed on to a CBO/Resident partnership group who
will continue the work once the CCI relationship sunsets.
